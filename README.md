<p>Coding is **totally** cool. It's the language of the computer, and I'm so curious about you all and how you work! I'd love to make some new friends--you're all so creative, so don't mind me barging in like a <pstyle="color:#f769f0;>space invader</p>:D</br>
<p>Practice makes progress. **Never** give up!</body>

<body>
<p>though the stars shimmer,</br>
<p>your glimmering eyes tell me</br>
<p>another day will come.</p>
